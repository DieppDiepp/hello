+ Use cd to go to next folder
+ Use dir to see all directories

Step 2: Type:  git clone https://github.com/DieppDiepp/hi.git example_repo2
+ Link is : the link of the repository
+ example_repo2 : the name of the folder in your computer that you want to connect to GitHub

Step 3: 
+ git status : to see the currently status (what file was add in to Git, what file was not, what files have been modified, ..)
+ git add test.py : add file test.py to the git (Now this file is still only your local computer)
+ git commit -m "First commit" : Package all the file that have been added to Git and put it in "First commit"
+ git push origin main : Push the "First commit" to the GitHub (Now you can see it in Github website)
